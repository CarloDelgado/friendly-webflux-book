## Description

Reactive applications are built on four core principles: responsiveness, resilency, elasticity, message-driven communication. Spring Webflux is a new member of the Spring ecosystem, that allows to create reactive systems on top of Project Reactor and Netty server. It is suitable for a wide range of solutions, including classical monoliths, microservices or serverless business functions. This book takes great care in covering different aspects of web programming, including topics, such as unit and load testing, authentication and authorization (JWT, TOTP), databases. The "Friendly Webflux" book originated from the author's practical experience as a Java software engineer in various domains, including ERP, health care and MMO games. Finally, the book covers some important topics of frontend development and communication with Spring Webflux-based backend, such as authentication or caching. Frontend examples are implemented using Vue.js, yet they can be ported in an effortless way to React.js and Svelte.js.
